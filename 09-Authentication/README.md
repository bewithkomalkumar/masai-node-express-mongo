    This post outlines my top 50 must-have CLI tools, which I've come to rely on. If there's anything I'm missing - do let me know in the comments :)

    At the end of the article, I've included some scripts to help you automate the installation and updating of these tools on various systems/ distros.",

For Logged In User

* Server should not allow Client to send `author` details
* Server should inject these details before adding the post in DB

For each request, 
* Is the user logged-in
* Who is logged-in user

Server identifies using headers

Server will prepare this token when user logs in
Client has to store this and send this token in each request

token: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"

1. GET /user/loggedInUser
   * `token` -> if this token in request is valid -> Server will give user details
   * `token` -> if this is invalid -> Server will give error message
   * If no token token is present then Server will say not logged in
2. POST /user/login -> `token`
3. POST /user/register
4. POST /post 
   * if `token` is present in req header, then server will identify the logged in user and it will store `author` details according to the token
